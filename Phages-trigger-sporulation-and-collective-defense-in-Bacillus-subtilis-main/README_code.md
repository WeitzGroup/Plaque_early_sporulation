# Phage Infection Fronts Trigger Early Sporulation and Collective Defense in *Bacillus subtilis* Populations

## Description
This repository contains the computational models and data analysis related to our paper titled "Phage infection fronts trigger early sporulation and collective defense in Bacillus subtilis populations". In this study, we explore how phage infection fronts can trigger early sporulation and a collective defense mechanism in *Bacillus subtilis* thus affecting phage spread in spatially structured environments. Our findings suggest that sporulation can act as a collective defense mechanism against phage infections, highlighting alternative mechanisms by which infection-induced signaling can self-limit infections at population scales. The project encompasses computational models and experimental data analysis, aiming to provide insights into the dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions in spatially structured environments.

## Repository Contents

### Code Files (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Model R:** Model with Resource-only dependent dormancy.
- **Model V:** Model with Contact mediated dormancy (with and without time delay).
- **Model M:** Model with Messenger molecule mediated dormancy (with and without time delay).

Each Jupyter notebook runs independently and corresponds to a specific dormancy model explored in the study.

### Data Files
Comparing theoretical predictions from our modeling with the actual experimental results.
- **Splus_data: Plaque Size Data (Sporulating Bacteria):** Experimental data on plaque sizes formed by phages lysing sporulating bacteria.
- **Sminus_data: Plaque Size Data for Non-Sporulating Bacteria:** Data for plaques formed on non-sporulating bacteria.
